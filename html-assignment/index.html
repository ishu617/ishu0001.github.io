            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is <em>Ishu</em>, and I am currently a student at Algonquin College. I am totally new to this course and had zero knowledge in the past about this program. It was hard for me at first, but now I am understanding everything.
                When I am free, I love to watch movies, spend time with my friends, and play cricket. My team always used to get 1<sup>st</sup> place in tournaments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in learning and gaining knowledge about new things. I love <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
                I know I will become successful in coding, and I see a great career in this.
            </p>
